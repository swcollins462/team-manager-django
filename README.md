# Team Manager App

Project by Stephen Collins

Hosting link:

Team Manager is a responsive web app for youth sports teams. It allows users to organize a team roster and store it in the cloud where it can be accessed from multiple devices. A new user can register for an account after providing a name and email address, then create a personal list of players. Functionality includes viewing a list of players, viewing players individually, adding new players, updating existing players, and deleting players.

Coded using Python Django.

Future improvements could include:

1. drag-and-drop reordering
2. ability to sort the table based on various columns
3. ability for one user to manage multiple teams
